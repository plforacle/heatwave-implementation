# Backup MySQL DB System


## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn to manage backups in a MySQL DB System.

_Estimated Time:_ 15 minutes


### Objectives

In this lab, you will be guided through the following tasks:

- Create a Manual Backup 
- Edit the Backup Plan of a DB System
- Restore to a new DB System from a Manual Backup
- Restore to a new DB System from a Point-in-Time
- Delete unused MySQL Backups

    ![databases click restore](./images/click-restore-backup.png "select restore backup")

2. Select **Restore from a backup**, then click the **Select backup** button to open the **Browse all backup** page 

    ![databases restore](./images/restore-from-backup.png "restore from backup")

3. Click the **Manual** button and select the check box next to the **Manual Backup** you created before. Then Click **Select Backup** 
    ![databases restore](./images/restore-backup-config.png "restore from manual backup config")

4. Ensure the root compartment is selected and enter the name of the new DB System, and Select **Standalone** option
    ```bash
    <copy>NEWDB</copy>
    ```
    ![databases restore](./images/restore-from-manual-backup.png "restore from manual backup")

5. Under Configure Networking section, ensure the HEATWAVE-VCN and its private subnet are selected 
    ![databases restore](./images/restore-backup-create-db.png "restore backup create-db")

6. Ensure that the **MySQL.HeatWave.VM.Standard** shape is selected. 

    ![databases restore](./images/restore-backup-create-db-shape.png "restore backup create db shape")

    If not, click on **Change Shape** and look for and select the **MySQL.HeatWave.VM.Standard** shape.

7. Leave **Data Storage Size** as it is.

8. On Configure Backups, disable 'Enable Automatic Backup'

    ![databases restore](./images/restore-edit-backup-plan.png "restore edit backup plan") 

9. Click on **Show Advanced Options** and go to the **Connections** tab, assign **NEWDB** as the new hostname. 

    Then click **Restore**

    ![databases restore](./images/restore-backup-create.png "restore from backup create")

    **Note**: It may take a few minures for the DB system to be created. When the DB System satate changes to Active, the DB System is ready to use.




## Task 4: Restore a Backup to a New DB System at a Point in Time

1. 1. Click **Navigation Menu**

    ![OCI Console Home Page](./images/homepage.png "home page")

    Then click **Restore**
    ![databases restore](./images/restore-backup-create.png "restore from backup create")

## Task 5: Delete a Backup

2. Click  **Databases**, then **Backups**  
    ![menu databases](./images/menu-databases-backups.png "menu dbsystems backups")

    ![use root compartment](./images/select-compartment.png "use root comparment")

3. Click the **Actions** button next to the Manual Backup you created previously, and select **Delete** from the drop-down menu

    > **Note**: 
    - It may take a few minutes for the backup to be deleted.
    - Disable PITR (as itâ€™s not compatible with Lakehouse) or disable backups completely to avoid issues later.
 
You may now **proceed to the next lab**
